# Mental Health App
This is our 2019 nwHacks submission. This was the first time any of us had worked on a web application project.

To combat the the growing issue with mental health, and the fact that students especially are not getting the help they need when they need it, we have created a platform which allows students to sign up with us and get matched with someone else perhaps going through similar problems who can share their experiences and listen to what they have to say over something like coffee.

Throughout this hackathon we were able to learn a lot about web development, getting familiar with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS with the help of mentors and worksessions provided by the hackathon!
